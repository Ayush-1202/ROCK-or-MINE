# ROCK-or-MINE
## Overview
This project aims to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar data using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on the "Sonar" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains sonar returns from 208 objects. The goal is to build a model that can accurately distinguish between rocks and mines.
