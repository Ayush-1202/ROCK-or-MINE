# ROCK-or-MINE
## Overview
This project aims to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar data using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on the "Sonar" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains sonar returns from 208 objects. The goal is to build a model that can accurately distinguish between rocks and mines.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: Essential for numerical computations and data arrays.
- **scikit-learn**: Provides machine learning algorithms and utilities for model building and evaluation.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Used for text preprocessing and tokenization.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building interactive web applications.

## Dataset

- **Source**: The sonar dataset used in this project is sourced from the Sonar Data csv.
